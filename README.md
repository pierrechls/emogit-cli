# emogit-cli

> Simple CLI to easily add and commit multiple files with a custom message and emoji support

![preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierrechls/emogit-cli/master/emogit-preview.gif)

Select **multiples** files to add or commit from the terminal is not very ~~sexy~~. Moreover, using **emojis** on commit messages provides an easy way of identifying the purpose or intention of a commit with only looking at the emojis used.  That's why I decided to create a command line to make this process **easy**.

## 🚀 How to use it

#### Install emogit as a global package

```bash
$ npm i -g emogit-cli
```

#### Have fun

```bash
$ emogit add     # add multiple untracked files in what will be committed
$ emogit commit  # commit multiple files with an emoji and a custom message
```
